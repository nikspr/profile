  <h2>Product Manager</h2>
  <p>👨‍💻 Tech-curious and relentlessly user-focused, I'm constantly exploring functional and simple solutions that solve real-world problems.</p>

  <h2>🤡 Product Management 🤡</h2>
  <p>As a Product Manager, I've had the opportunity to herd cats, I mean, lead cross-functional teams to create products that make us all a boatload of money. From inception to launch, I enjoy playing referee between engineers, designers, and stakeholders to deliver products that solve problems we never knew existed. I thrive in fast-paced environments, and I can juggle more balls than a circus clown, all while keeping my cool.</p>

  <h2>🌱 Got-To-Market 🌱</h2>
  <p>My job is to make sure we sell you things you don't need, to people who don't want them, at a time when they're too busy to care. From coming up with clever slogans and taglines to creating a full-blown launch plan, I excel at making you think you can't live without our products. I'm basically a magician, but instead of pulling a rabbit out of a hat, I pull a profit out of thin air.</p>

  <h2>💸 Venture Capital 💸</h2>
  <p>I mostly spend my days sifting through mountains of pitch decks from wannabe entrepreneurs trying to convince me that their app will change the world. I try to make sense of financial statements and market analyses, pretending like I know what I'm doing in due diligence calls with startup founders. But hey, maybe one day I'll get to lead a deal and make it rain with those sweet, sweet VC dollars.</p>
